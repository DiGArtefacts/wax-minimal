Abba Sahib Cheena is located at 72°13’ E, 34°.37’ N, approximately 6 kilometers from Barikot on Barikot-Buner road (Faccenna & Spagnesi, 2014). One must take right, a little off the Najigram village road leading to shrine of Mashoom Shaheed, where a water sprite is leading right to Mandara nullah, which descends from Mount Sur-ghar. As it continues, the valley narrows within the steep mountains slope, which are partly covered by pine tree (unfortunately now sparse as many have been cut). This led to the central zone of the great monumental Buddhist complex of Abba Sahib Cheena (Tucci, 1958). A little further on there is a stream; on the mountain slopes, particularly on the West side, there are numerous buildings, sparse, isolated, supported by substructures walls, several quite large and of particular interest as regards typology, layout, and architectural elements.
